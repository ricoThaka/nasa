### WHAT HiView DOES
HiView is a data explorer and image viewing application supporting the [JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image format ![HiVeiw](https://www.uahirise.org/hiview/images/main-splash-screen.jpg) HiView is the best way to explore HiRISE images of the Martian surface at the full resolution of the imagery. Tracks of boulders that have fallen down crater walls, delicate rays of ejecta from fresh impact craters, and the unearthly formations created by carbon dioxide ice on the Martian south pole are just a few of the things that are waiting to be discovered by anyone using a tool like HiView with HiRISE imagery.

### A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States
## 1968: East Los Angeles Walkouts
Discrepancies in the education of Anglo and Mexican-American students surfaced in Los Angeles during the 1950s and 1960s. Mexican-American students experienced a 60% dropout rate from high school, and those who did graduate averaged the reading level of an 8th grade Anglo student. In some schools, teachers prohibited students from speaking Spanish, and in others, school staff recommended Mexican-American students educational curriculum meant to help students with mental disabilities. These schools funneled many Mexican American students into vocational programs and discouraged from post-secondary studies. In response, students, teachers, parents, and activists began to organize.[ContinueReading](https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/east-la-walkouts) [Related Tweet EastLosangeles Today](https://x.com/RicoThaka/status/1831786037527638408)

### Dear Rep/Mayor Karen,
I signed up for a class that [NASAJPL](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) is offering at [CourtYard by Marriot Pasadena](https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/courtyard-los-angeles-pasadena-monrovia.html). As you can see in the [LAPD DETAinMENT on METROLA PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricoThaka/ricothaka.github.io/pixelsquare/assets/pdf/image.pdf), I was accused of Tresspassing. I i dont know what i need to do to use the transit system safely. LAPD is pushing [FareEnforcement](https://abc7.com/post/metro-safety-stopping-fare-evaders-seen-key-preventing-crime/15054806/) but are not making exceptions. If you look at the graphic below in my [GMAiL_EMAiL_iNBOX](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXd4idMbwAUqOMQ?format=jpg&name=large) you will see that Los Angeles Police never emailed me back after i was victim of that Armed Gunman at CityHAll with the Playboy Backpack on, so this Tap card thing. I see people at Saint Francis with MailBoxes and There is this place in Santa Monica that offer mailboxes, but im in a different situation since i was Abandoned. I took a shower at [Reality_LA](https://realityla.com/), AND I KNOW The Medicated Shampoo and Terry Cloth towel Pulled out at least 200 bugs! The Larve breask my hair down and it just cracks off while Dry Scapl tortures me with itching and burning. Please send a team from NasaJPL to talk to them about what [Entomological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_warfare#:~:text=EW%20is%20a%20specific%20type,the%20insects%20over%20target%20areas.) looks like in [Los Angeles ](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530979.pdf).

So I want to make sure i can make the [ECOSTRESS Science and Application Team Meeting - Fall 2024](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) meeting and start making more progress on getting my badge back. Whereever my daughter is, Erika, and the dancing girls... Id dont matter! I have to be badged.

### Los Angeles 

Urban Heat Image 

![LOSANGELESHEATWAVE](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/downloads/gallery/urbanheat/00116_LST_over_LA.jpg)

[Greater Los Angeles](https://lacounty.gov/emergency/) is a prime example of an urban heat island - cities and suburbs woven with heat-trapping concrete and asphalt that lead to warmertemperatures than nearby rural areas that have more vegetation. Bordered by mountains and the ocean, the Greater L.A. area encompasses suburbs andskyscrapers, with a dense population and disparities in green space. It includes several counties, tens of thousands of square miles, and more than18 million people, making it a compelling test bed for heat wave research.

Climate change and urban heat are together fueling different heat waves now. In the 20th century, most heat waves in L.A. were dry. However, humidevents have steadily increased in frequency and intensity since 1950 due in part to swelling moisture from the warming sea surface.

In their case study, JPL scientists compared two heat waves that affected the Greater Los Angeles area in the summer of 2020: a prolonged muggystretch in August and an extremely dry three-day spike in September. During the latter event, record-breaking temperatures soared over 120 degreesFahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in the San Fernando Valley - a densely populated portion of the city of Los Angeles - while scorching winds fanned adestructive wildfire in the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. For their study, recently published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology,the scientists used NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) data set - a reanalysis of historicalatmospheric observations. They found that both heat waves drove temperatures above the 90th percentile for the August-September climate record in L.A.Using advanced weather modeling, they simulated the heat waves and looked at their impacts across the region [Continue Reading](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/galleryimage_urban)

### [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Justice_(Los_Angeles))
The Hall of Justice in Los Angeles is located at 211 W. Temple Street in the Civic Center district of Downtown Los Angeles. It occupies the southern two-thirds of the block between Temple and First streets and between Broadway and Spring streets.

Built in 1925, it was together with Los Angeles City Hall the first two large buildings opened in what would over the following decades demolish and transform the late-19th-century Central Business District to a Civic Center of modern landmark buildings and plazas. @LACMVA

This data visualization shows 50 years of algal blooms collected across a spinning globe. Once all the data is accumulated, the globe then unwraps into a Robinson projection so the viewer can see the entire global dataset.

### NASA Wants to Identify Phytoplankton Species from Space. Hereâ€™s Why.



Theyâ€™re small, but theyâ€™re mighty. From producing oxygen we breathe to soaking up carbon we emit to feeding fish we eat, tiny phytoplankton are a crucial part of ocean ecosystems and essential to life as we know it on Earth. To give us a new view of these extraordinary aquatic organisms, NASA is launching a satellite in early 2024.

Instruments on the PACE (short for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem) satellite will peer down at the ocean and collect data on the colors of light reflecting off it, telling us where different types of phytoplankton are thriving. Ivona CetiniÄ‡, the Science Lead for Ocean Biogeochemistry for PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) describes the weird, wonderful and important world of phytoplankton and why it's important for the PACE mission to study these tiny creatures.

## RegEx 
[webrename](https://www.webrename.com/) <~ Bulk file renamer takes regex. I got stuck on [ricothaka.github.io/worknotes02](ricothaka.github.io/worknotes02) bc the scanner at LaPL central spits out horrible filenames. I found great images from Mariner for Robins Weather Chores. Its old but as time rolls on im understanding the fact that historical weather data can help you uinderstand the present
