### Passing parameters to includes

You can also pass parameters to an include. For example, suppose you have a file called `note.html` in your `_includes` folder that contains this formatting:

{% raw %}
```liquid
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b>
{{ include.content }}
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

Normani please look at this old post, it is a marker for how long i have been focused on Programming CSS 
# SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21TH, 2021
# Im working on CSS

Since I'm publishing using [##GiTHUB_PAGES](https://pages.github.com/), alot of administration needs are met from my [GiTHUB_ACCOUNT](https://github.com/ThakaRashard), I can focus on coding. [Cascading Style Sheets is a legit programming language for the browser](http://www.csszengarden.com/216/). Using the site David Shea Started, I can get this Jekyll account to another level. I really need this book [The Zen of CSS](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/565.The_Zen_of_CSS_Design) he published. I have to create navigation to my resume and create a contact page. Im using [GiTHUB Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) to manage individual pages right now because it is a small site and I want [psychological separation](https://www.separationadvice.net/psychological-separation/) which social media does not provide. I was blackballed on Linkedin for just not knowing enough for my age, and my family+romance life. Every woman that committed to me was sold into sex slavery and kidnapped by ##INSTAGRAM_PiMPS_and_MARKETED_iN_FACEBOOK_BROTHELS. They are still trafficked as prostitutes. IT people in the DEVOPS generation often fool themselves into thinking prostitution is normal and the family which is affected is the problem. This view has left people with familes discriminated against in the ##IT_MARKETPLACE, but here in Los Angeles after 2 years of homelessness, I sense my luck changing... So Im working hard to clean up my image and reputation outside social media, which has brought me closer to my family

### [Tesla Coils at Griffith Observatory video](https://griffithobservatory.org/) 

[Tesla coil is an electrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891.[1] It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity.[2][3] Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.
