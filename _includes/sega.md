G-LOC: Air Battle (G-LOC meaning "G-force induced Loss Of Consciousness") is a 1990 air combat simulator arcade game developed by Sega AM2 for the Sega Y Board hardware. It is a spiritual sequel to After Burner II, featuring similar gameplay ideas and some recycled sound effects, though has always been publicly advertised as a different game entirely. The original arcade version runs on more advanced Sega Y Board hardware, and makes heavy use of sprite scaling & rotation and pre-rendered 3D graphics, anticipating the look of early texture-mapped 3D polygons.

G-LOC is notable for being one of the first video games to offer an R360 arcade cabinet which could rotate 360 degrees on all three axes, immersing the player in the action. These versions of the game are sometimes referred to as G-LOC R360, though the gameplay itself is identical. The game was followed by Strike Fighter in 1991 [ReaDMore](https://segaretro.org/G-LOC:_Air_Battle) [The Inverted Approach – Retro SEGA Game ‘G-LOC Air Battle’ Inspires My Latest Challenge in Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.stateaviationjournal.com/index.php/front-page-slider/the-inverted-approach-retro-sega-game-g-loc-air-battle-inspires-my-latest-challenge-in-microsoft-flight-simulator)

## sEGA Genesis – FJ846EUsAsEGA
Variation #1 – Sometimes referred to as the “Sonic” version. This version looks the same as the original but SEGA added the License Screen that would pop-up before each game, adding about 3-4 seconds to your initial wait time to get to the gaming. Also, from this revision on SEGA installed a “Lock-Out” chip for regional restrictions. The FCC-ID code for this unit is: FJ8USASEGA.
